	abstract = {<p>Caching Web objects has become a common practicetowards improving content delivery and users{\^a}{\texteuro}{\texttrademark} servicing.A Web caching framework is characterized by its cachereplacement policy, which identifies the objects (i.e. theelements on a Web page, which include text, graphics,and scripts) to be replaced in a cache upon a requestarrival. In this paper, we present a cache replacementalgorithm (so-called FRES-CAR), which identifies theobjects that should be evicted by considering togetherthree important criteria: object{\^a}{\texteuro}{\texttrademark}s frequency, recency andsize. Experimentation under synthetic workloads hasshown that FRES-CAR achieves higher hit rates whencompared with the most popular and existing algorithms.</p>
