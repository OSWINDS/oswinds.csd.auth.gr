Web proxy servershave an important role in reducing server loads, networktraffic, and client request latencies. This paper presentsa detailed workload characterization study of a busyWeb proxy server. The study aims in identifying themajor characteristics which will improve modelling ofWeb proxy accessing. A set of log files is processed forworkload characterization. Throughout the study,emphasis is given on identifying the criteria for a Webcaching model. A statistical analysis, based on theprevious criteria, is presented in order to characterizethe major workload parameters. Results of this analysisare presented and the paper concludes with a discussionabout workload characterization and content deliveryissues.</p>
