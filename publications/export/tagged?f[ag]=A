%X <div>Smart cities evolve over multiple themes and areas with the development of cyber-physical systems and smart services that address several urban issues regarding economy, mobility,&nbsp; environment, people, living and governance. This evolution has bliged the definition of several conceptualization and evaluation models, which respect alternative smart city perspectives. This work proposes smart city profiling with the introduction of the “CityDNA” model, ccording which, smart city’s dimensions’ relevance can be captured and visualized. Based on this model, a smart city’s profile can be defined and characterized, under a simple comprehensive view of local needs and challenges. A particular smart city scenario is highlighted as a proof of concept for CityDNA and future design and implementation ideas are identified and justified.</div>

%X <p>Social networking data threads emerge rapidly and such crowd-driven big data streams are valuable for detecting trends and opinions. For such analytics, conventional data mining approaches are challenged by both high-dimensionality and scalability concerns. Here, we leverage on the Cloud4Trends framework, for collecting and analyzing geo-located microblogging content, partitioned into clusters under cloud-based infrastructures. Different cloud architectures are proposed to offer flexible solutions for geo-located data analytics, with emphasis on incremental trend analysis. The proposed architectures are largely based on a set of service modules which facilitate the deployment of the experimentation on Cloud infrastructures. Several experimentation remarks are highlighted to showcase the requirements and testing capabilities of different cloud computing settings.</p>

%X <p>Social networks have become big data production engines and their analytics can reveal insightful trending topics, such that hidden knowledge can be utilized in various applications and settings. This paper addresses the problem of popular topics’ and trends’ early prediction out of social networks data streams which demand distributed software architectures. Under an online time series classification model, which is implemented in a flexible and adaptive distributed framework, trending topics are detected. Emphasis is placed on the early detection process and on the performance of the proposed framework. The implemented framework builds on the lambda architecture design and the experimentation carried out highlights the usefulness of the proposed approach in early trends detection with high rates in performance and with a validation aligned with a popular microblogging service.</p>

%X <p>Smart city infrastructures provide unique opportunities for innovative applications developing and testing. Sensor city installations offer the ground for experimenting with user-oriented services, which at the same time can test and improve the infrastructure itself. The proposed work summarizes principles and methodology for and experiment, entitled SEN2SOC which will bridge sensor measurements and social networks interactions via natural language generation for supporting smart city services. SEN2SOC aims at exploiting the SmartSantander infrastructure in a sensor to social reciprocal fashion such that the sensor measurements will be and communicated to the public (citizens,authorities, etc), while social networks users activities in relevance to sensors social postings will be analyzed and summarized both to verify sensors reporting and to develop collective aware applications.</p>

%X <p>The rapid evolution of the web has affected the way under which the manufacturing process is practised.In this paper, a web based framework â€“ independent from any specific CAD/CAM software â€“ is proposed,for employing electronic interaction between designers and manufacturers. In this context, designers andmanufacturers communicate for the manufacturing of a workpiece, under a platform-independent, easier,faster and more economical way. The proposed framework is implemented as a web service, wherethe Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) is used for the exchange of the necessary machined parts dataand the methodologies of UDDI (Universal Description Discovery and Integration) and WSDL (Web ServicesDescription Language) are introduced for providing directories and descriptions information.</p>

%X <p>Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) provide an efficient support for serving â€śresourcehungryâ€ťapplications while minimizing the network impact of content delivery as well asshifting the traffic away from overloaded origin servers. However, their performance gain islimited since the storage space in CDNâ€™s servers is not used optimally. In order to managetheir storage capacity in an efficient way, we integrate caching techniques in CDNs. Thechallenge is to decide which objects would be devoted to caching so as the CDNâ€™s server maybe used both as a replicator and as a proxy server. In this paper we propose a nonlinear nonparametricmodel which classifies the CDNâ€™s server cache into two parts. Through a detailedsimulation environment, we show that the proposed technique can yield significant reductionin user-perceived latency as compared with other heuristic schemes.</p>

%X <p>LDAP directories have rapidly emerged as the essentialframework for storing a wide range of heterogeneous information undervarious applications and services. Increasing amounts of informationare being stored in LDAP directories imposing the need for efficientdata organization and retrieval. In this paper, we propose the LPAIR&amp; LMERGE (LP-LM) hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithmfor improving LDAP data organization. LP-LM merges a pair of clustersat each step, considering the LD-vectors, which represent the entriesâ€™structure. The clustering-based LDAP data organization enhances LDAPserverâ€™s response times, under a specific query framework.</p>

%X One of the most elaborate and important tasks inbiology is the functional annotation of genes.Biologists have developed standardized and structuredvocabularies, called bio-ontologies, to assist them indescribing the different functions. A critical issue inthe assignment of functions to genes is the utilizationof knowledge from published biomedical articles. Thepurpose of this paper is to present a unified andcomprehensive statistical methodology for functionallyannotating genes using biomedical literature.Specifically, classification models are built using thediscriminant analysis method while validation,analysis and interpretation of the results is based ongraphical methods and various performance metricsand techniques. The general conclusions from thestudy are very promising, in the sense that theproposed methodology not only performs well in theassignment of functions to genes, but also providesuseful and interpretable results regarding thediscriminating power of certain keywords in the texts.

%X One of the main issues in Web usage mining is the discovery of patternsin the navigational behavior of Web users. Standard approaches, such as clusteringof usersâ€™sessions and discovering association rules or frequent navigational paths,do not generally allow to characterize or quantify the unobservable factors that leadto common navigational patterns. Therefore, it is necessary to develop techniquesthat can discover hidden and useful relationships among users as well as betweenusers and Web objects.Correspondence Analysis(CO-AN) is particularly useful inthis context, since it can uncover meaningful associations among users and pages.We present a model-based cluster analysis for Web users sessions including anovel visualization and interpretation approach which is based on CO-AN.

%X In our project, we adopt a new approach for handlingvideo data. We view the video as a well-defined datatype with its own description, parameters, and applicablemethods. The system is based on PREDATOR, the opensource object relational DBMS. PREDATOR uses Shoreas the underlying storage manager (SM). Supporting videooperations (storing, searching by content, and streaming)and new query types (query by examples and multi-featuressimilarity search) requires major changes in many ofthe traditional system components. More specifically,the storage and buffer manager will have to deal withhuge volumes of data with real time constraints. Queryprocessing has to consider the video methods and operatorsin generating, optimizing and executing query plans.

%X The performance of storage subsystems has not followed therapid improvements in processors technology, despite the increased capacityand density in storage medium. Here, we introduce a new modelbased on the idea of enhancing the I/O subsystem controller capabilitiesby dynamic load balancing on a storage subsystem of multiple disk drives.The request servicing is modified such that each request is directed to themost appropriate disk drive towards servicing performance improvement.The redirection is performed by a proposed algorithm which considersthe disk drive queues and the disk drives â€śpopularityâ€ť. The proposed requestservicing has been simulated and the load balancing approach hasbeen shown quite effective as compared to conventional request servicing.
