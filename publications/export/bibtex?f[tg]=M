	abstract = {<p>In recent years, bullying and aggression against users on social media have grown significantly, causing serious consequences to victims of all demographics. In particular, cyberbullying affects more than half of young social media users worldwide, and has also led to teenage suicides, prompted by prolonged and/or coordinated digital harassment. Nonetheless, tools and technologies for understanding and mitigating it are scarce and mostly ineffective. In this paper, we present a principled and scalable approach to detect bullying and aggressive behavior on Twitter. We propose a robust methodology for extracting text, user, and network-based attributes, studying the properties of cyberbullies and aggressors, and what features distinguish them from regular users. We find that bully users post less, participate in fewer online communities, and are less popular than normal users, while aggressors are quite popular and tend to include more negativity in their posts. We evaluate our methodology using a corpus of 1.6M tweets posted over 3 months, and show that machine learning classification algorithms can accurately detect users exhibiting bullying and aggressive behavior, achieving over 90\% AUC.</p>

	abstract = {<p>Over the past few years, online aggression and abusive behaviors have occurred in many different forms and on a variety of platforms. In extreme cases, these incidents have evolved into hate, discrimination, and bullying, and even materialized into real-world threats and attacks against individuals or groups. In this paper, we study the Gamergate controversy. Started in August 2014 in the online gaming world, it quickly spread across various social networking platforms, ultimately leading to many incidents of cyberbullying and cyberaggression. We focus on Twitter, presenting a measurement study of a dataset of 340k unique users and 1.6M tweets to study the properties of these users, the content they post, and how they differ from random Twitter users. We find that users involved in this "Twitter war" tend to have more friends and followers, are generally more engaged and post tweets with negative sentiment, less joy, and more hate than random users. We also perform preliminary measurements on how the Twitter suspension mechanism deals with such abusive behaviors. While we focus on Gamergate, our methodology to collect and analyze tweets related to aggressive and bullying activities is of independent interest.</p>

Efficient multimedia data contentdescription is a neccesary and critical issue towards whichseveral solutions have been proposed. In the present paper,we focus on the MPEG-7 standard as an efficient multimediacontent description tool. MPEG-7 is a newly introducedstandard from the MPEG commitee and a brief descriptionof the standard and its components is given here. MPEG-7 Language-Schema as used towards efficient Audio/Visualcontent description is discussed more extensively. As decidedby the MPEG-7 committee it the Description DefinitionLanguage (DDL) of the standard should be based onthe XML Schema. The several extensions to this schema,necessary for satisfying the requirements of MPEG-7 arediscussed, while other functionalities of the schema whichseem not necessary under current specifications are alsocommented.</p>

	year = {2001},
	abstract = {<p>Multimedia data storage is a critical issue in large scale applications.This paper proposes a frequency based multimedia data representationmodel which effectively guides data storage and elevation among the secondaryand tertiary storage levels. Multimedia data are stored on the tertiary storagelevel and (based on certain popularity criteria) they are elevated on secondarylevel towards improving both the request servicing and the data{\textquoteright}s accessibility.The proposed multimedia data elevation is a prefetching approach since it isperformed {\textquotedblleft}a priori{\textquotedblright} (not on demand) based on available information on usersaccess patterns. Secondary storage placement is performed by the use of twodistinct type placement policies, namely the {\textquotedblleft}Constructive Placement{\textquotedblright} and the{\textquotedblleft}Iterative Improvement{\textquotedblright} algorithms. A simulation model has been developedto evaluate the proposed hierarchical data model and the applied placementstrategies. Experimentation results have shown that the this hierarchical approachunder the iterative improvement placement outperforms earlier relatedmultimedia data placement policies.</p>
