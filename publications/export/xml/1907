The cloudcomputing paradigm appears to offer a significant benefit in orderto make such applications viable considering that the massive datasizes produced daily impose the need of a scalable and powerfulinfrastructure. Cloud4Trends constitutes an efficient Cloud-basedapproach in order to solve the online trend tracking problem basedon Web 2.0 sources. A detailed system architecture model is alsoproposed, which is largely based on a set of service modulesdeveloped within the VENUS-C research project to facilitate thedeployment of research applications on Cloud infrastructures.&lt;/p&gt;
