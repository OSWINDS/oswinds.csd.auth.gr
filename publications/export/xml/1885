Identical disks (comprising the shadowed disks) sets have been adopted as an effective secondary storage replication scheme. In the present paper, we introduce a shadowed disk model and mathematically analyze its theoritical expected performance measures by applying the nearer-server rule to satisfy the requests. In addition, we introduce the corresponding simulation model, where each disk is modeled by means of a protoype disk configuration and specific commercial disks metrics. Furthermore, the mirrored disks model is studied extensively as a boundary disk topology of the shadowed disks set. The developed simulation model is experimented and tested under various workloads produced by real I/O traces. The performance of the simulation model is compared to the analytical results and, thus, it is validated since analysis and simulation give close results.&lt;/p&gt;
