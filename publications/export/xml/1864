These limitations (no structureon tags, tags validation, spamming and redundancy)are more evident in the case of multi-media contentdue to its challenging automatic annotation and retrievalrequirements. In this paper, we present an approachfor social data clustering which combinesjointly semantic, social and content-based information.We propose an unsupervised model for efficient andscalable mining on multimedia social-related data,which leads to the extraction of rich and trustworthysemantics and the improvement of retrieval in a socialtagging system. Experimental results demonstrate theefficiency of the proposed approach.&lt;/p&gt;
