In this paper we claim thatholding a temporal dimension, allows for tracking macroscopic and microscopicusers’ interests, detecting emerging trends and recognizing events. To this end, wepropose a time-aware co-clustering approach for acquiring semantic and temporalpatterns out of the tagging activity. The resulted clusters contain both users and tagsof similar patterns over time, and reveal non-obvious or “hidden” relations amongusers and topics of their common interest. Zoom in &amp;amp; out views serve as visualizationmethods on different aspects of the clusters’ structure, in order to evaluate theefficiency of the approach.&lt;/p&gt;
