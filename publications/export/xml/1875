Efficient multimedia data contentdescription is a neccesary and critical issue towards whichseveral solutions have been proposed. In the present paper,we focus on the MPEG-7 standard as an efficient multimediacontent description tool. MPEG-7 is a newly introducedstandard from the MPEG commitee and a brief descriptionof the standard and its components is given here. MPEG-7 Language-Schema as used towards efficient Audio/Visualcontent description is discussed more extensively. As decidedby the MPEG-7 committee it the Description DefinitionLanguage (DDL) of the standard should be based onthe XML Schema.
