	abstract = {<p>Online text sources form evolving large scale data repositories out of which valuable knowledge about human emotions can be derived. Beyond the primary emotions which refer to the global emotional signals, deeper understanding of a wider spectrum of emotions is important to detect online public views and attitudes. The present work is motivated by the need to test and provide a system that categorizes emotion in online activities. Such a system can be beneficial for online services, companies recommendations, and social support communities. The main contributions of this work are to: (a) detect primary emotions, social ones, and those that characterize general affective states from online text sources, (b) compare and validate different emotional analysis processes to highlight the most efficient, and (c) provide a proof of concept case study to monitor and validate online activity, both explicitly and implicitly. The proposed approaches are tested on three datasets collected from different sources, i.e., news agencies, Twitter, and Facebook, and on different languages, i.e., English and Greek. Study results demonstrate that the methodologies at hand succeed to detect a wider spectrum of emotions out of text sources.</p>

This paper addresses the problem of popular topics{\textquoteright} and trends{\textquoteright} early prediction out of social networks data streams which demand distributed software architectures. Under an online time series classification model, which is implemented in a flexible and adaptive distributed framework, trending topics are detected. Emphasis is placed on the early detection process and on the performance of the proposed framework. The implemented framework builds on the lambda architecture design and the experimentation carried out highlights the usefulness of the proposed approach in early trends detection with high rates in performance and with a validation aligned with a popular microblogging service.</p>

	abstract = {<p>Web communities comprising of documents and/or users activities have beenformed and are continuously expanding and transforming as Web users role shiftsfrom typical navigations to content managing and regulating. Defining, deriving andexploiting communities is not a trivial task since several parameters (large-scale,complexity, evolving information etc) are involved. This paper aims at providinganswers for crucial questions raised about communities emerging in the Web and itsummarizes different community definitions such that then, the problem ofcommunity detection (which is well matured and researched in the past) isunderstood. The paper emphasizes and discusses the most important methodologiesand techniques which deal with large populations of Web documents participatingin vast hyperlinked networks, or networks formed from crawling (part of) the weband more recently, networks reflecting the social relations and/or interactions amongpeople. It is important to understand and categorize community identification effortsby taking into account that different levels of granularity and different views areoften used for community identification. The emphasis is on the intuition behind allthese methodologies and implementations, and on their practical impact for tasks ofrecommendation, searching, content outsourcing, etc.</p>

	abstract = {<p>The recent advent and wide adoption of Social BookmarkingSystems (SBS) has disrupted the traditional model of onlinecontent publishing. Until recently, the majority of content consumedby people was published as a result of a centralized selection process.Nowadays, large-scale adoption of the Web 2.0 paradigm hasdiffused the content selection to the masses. As a result, the evolutionof online content popularity nowadays constitutes an overly complexphenomenon involving both semantic and social aspects.Work in the era before the wide adoption of Web 2.0 mostly focusedon estimating web resource popularity under a web graphmodel. Recently, several aspects of the popularity dynamics emergingin the context of Web 2.0 applications have attracted significantresearch interest. Here, we introduce a formalism that enables thestudy of the dynamics underlying the popularity evolution of onlinecontent within an SBS. Based on this formalism, we carry out a studyof the diggTM popularity dynamics. Our study confirms the powerlaw nature of content popularity in SBS, and presents new insightsinto the temporal aspects of popularity under the influence of the socialfactor.</p>

This paper considers aclient/server model which employs a polling policy as itsaccess strategy. We propose a learning-automata-based approachfor polling in order to improve the throughput-delayperformance of the system. Each client has an associatedqueue and the server performs selective polling such thatthe next client to be served is identified by a learning automaton.The learning automaton updates each client{\textquoteright}schoice probability according to the feedback information.Under the considered approach, a client{\textquoteright}s choice probabilityasymptotically tends to be proportional to the probabilitythat this client is ready. Simulation results have shown thatthe proposed polling policy is beneficial in comparison tothe conventional round-robin polling when operating underbursty traffic conditions. The benefits are significant for thedelay reduction in the considered client/server system.</p>
