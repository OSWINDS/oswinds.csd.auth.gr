	abstract = {<p>This paper describes an approach for semantic description and retrieval of multimedia data described by means ofMPEG-7. This standard uses XML schema to define the descriptions. Therefore, it lacks ability to represent the data semanticsin a formal and concise way and it does not allow integration and use of domain specific knowledge. Moreover,inference mechanisms are not provided and hence the extraction of implicit information is not (always) possible. To addressthese issues, we propose to add a conceptual layer on top of MPEG-7 metadata layer, where the domain knowledgeis represented using a formal language. A set of mapping rules is proposed. They serve as a bridge between the twolayers.Querying MPEG-7 descriptions using XML query languages such as XPath or XQuery requires to know MPEG-7syntax and documents structure. To provide a flexible query formulation, we exploit the conceptual layer vocabularyto express user queries. A user query, making reference to terms specified at the conceptual level, is rewritten into anXQuery expression over MPEG-7 descriptions.</p>

	abstract = {Nowadays, the amount of multimedia data is increasingrapidly, and hence, there is an increasing need for efficientmethods to manage the multimedia content. This paper proposesa framework for the description and retrieval of multimediadata. The data are represented at both the syntactic(structure, metadata and low level features) and semantic(the meaning of the data) levels. We use the MPEG-7 standard,which provides a set of tools to describe multimediacontent from different viewpoints, to represent the syntacticlevel. However, due to its XML Schema based representation,MPEG-7 is not suitable to represent the semanticaspect of the data in a formal and concise way. Moreover,inferential mechanisms are not provided. To alleviate theselimitations, we propose to extend MPEG-7 with a domainontology, formalized using a logical formalism. Then, thesemantic aspect of the data is described using the ontology{\^a}{\texteuro}{\texttrademark}svocabulary, as a set of logical expressions. We enhancethe ontology by a rules layer, to describe more complexconstraints between domain concepts and relations.User{\^a}{\texteuro}{\texttrademark}s queries may concern the syntactic and/or semanticfeatures. The syntactic constraints are expressed usingXQuery language and evaluated using an XML query engine;whereas the semantic query constraints are expressedusing a rules language and evaluated using a specific resolutionmechanism.},

	abstract = {<p>This paper deals with the problem of finding multimediadata that fulfill the requirements of user queries. We assumeboth the user query and the multimedia data are expressedby MPEG-7 standard. The MPEG-7 formalism lacks thesemantics and reasoning support in many ways. For example,the search of the implicit data can not be achieved,due to its description based on XML schema. We propose aframework for querying multimedia data based on a tree embeddingapproximation algorithm, combining the MPEG-7standard and an ontology</p>
