	abstract = {<p>XML{\textquoteright}s increasing diffusion makes efficient XML query processing and indexing all the more critical. Given the semistructured nature of XML documents, however, general query processing techniques won{\textquoteright}t work. Researchers have proposed several specialized indexing methods that offer query processors efficient access to XML documents, although none are yet fully implemented in commercial products. In this article the classification of XML indexing techniques identifies current practices and trends, offering insight into how developers can improve query processing and select the best solution for particular contexts.</p>

	abstract = {<p>Extensible Markup Language (XML) has been widely used as a middleware because of its flexibility. Fixeddomain is one of the bottlenecks of Information Extraction (IE) technologies. In this paper we present aXML-based domain-adaptable bootstrapping method of pattern acquisition, which focuses on minimizingthe cost of domain migration. The approach starts from a seed corpus with some seed patterns; extends thecorpus based on the seed corpus through the Internet and acquires the new patterns from extended corpus.Positive and negative examples classified from training corpus are used to evaluate the patterns acquired.The result shows our method is a practical way in pattern acquisitions.</p>

Thispaper proposes a framework for overcoming the difficulties that arise due to thedistribution and heterogeneity of current collaborative educational technologies. Theproposed framework is based on XML it is of distributive and cooperative naturesince it is characterized by the following:{\textbullet} Each educational organization may plan its development to meet its own needs.{\textbullet} It is possible for each organization to concurrently reuse the software that hasalready been developed by any other organization,{\textbullet} Each organization can combine its own software production, with the productionof other cooperative organizations, in various ways.</p>
