Since each user has his/her own understanding and point of view of a given document, we propose an approach in which the index model provides a Personalized Social Document Representation (PerSaDoR) of each document per user based on his/her activities in a social tagging system. The proposed approach relies on matrix factorization to compute the PerSaDoR of documents that match a query, at query time. The complexity analysis shows that our approach scales linearly with the number of documents that match the query, and thus, it can scale to very large datasets. PerSaDoR has been also intensively evaluated by an offline study and by a user survey operated on a large public dataset from delicious showing significant benefits for personalized search compared to state of the art methods.</p>

	abstract = {<p>The performance of a disk with two heads per surface separatedby a fixed number of cylinders is examined. We derive the probabilitydistribution of arm stops, the expected number of stops as well asthe expected number of cylinder clusters, i.e. the number of sets of consecutivecompound cylinders. In comparison with a single-headed disk,it is shown that the performance gain may reach 50\% on the average.</p>

In the context of Web datamining, model-based clustering algorithms are often usedto cluster similar users{\textquoteright} sessions in order to determineWebsite access behaviors. An important issue in clusteranalysis is the evaluation of clustering results to find thepartitioning that best fits the underlying data. In thispaper, we present a novel validation technique for modelbasedclustering approaches.</p>

Several scheduling algorithms have been adopted to serve read and write requests, and the expected seek has been calculated and compared to that of single-headed disk systems. Data placement schemes have been also studied in conjunction with the scheduling algorithms in order to study the efficiency and fault tolerance of two-headed disk systems. Probability theory and simulation models have been used to achieve results and reach conclusions.</p>
