	abstract = {In our project, we adopt a new approach for handlingvideo data. We view the video as a well-defined datatype with its own description, parameters, and applicablemethods. The system is based on PREDATOR, the opensource object relational DBMS. PREDATOR uses Shoreas the underlying storage manager (SM). Supporting videooperations (storing, searching by content, and streaming)and new query types (query by examples and multi-featuressimilarity search) requires major changes in many ofthe traditional system components. More specifically,the storage and buffer manager will have to deal withhuge volumes of data with real time constraints. Queryprocessing has to consider the video methods and operatorsin generating, optimizing and executing query plans.},
