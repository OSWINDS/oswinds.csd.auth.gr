	abstract = {<p>This paper describes the participation of CERTH in the {\^a}{\texteuro}{\'s}SocialEvent Detection Task @ MediaEval 2011{\^a}{\texteuro}{\v t}, which aimsat discovering social events in a large photo collection. Thetask comprises two challenges: (i) identification of soccerevents in the cities of Barcelona and Rome, and (ii) identificationof events taking place in two specific venues. Weadopt an approach that combines spatial and temporal filterswith tag-based location classification models and an ef-ficient photo clustering method. In our best runs, we achieveF-measure and NMI scores of 77.4\% and 0.63 respectivelyfor Challenge 1, and 64\% and 0.38 for Challenge 2.</p>
