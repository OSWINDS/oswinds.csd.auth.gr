%X <p>In recent years, offensive, abusive and hateful language, sexism, racism and other types of aggressive and cyberbullying behavior have been manifesting with increased frequency, and in many online social media platforms. In fact, past scientific work focused on studying these forms in popular media, such as Facebook and Twitter. Building on such work, we present an 8-month study of the various forms of abusive behavior on Twitter, in a holistic fashion. Departing from past work, we examine a wide variety of labeling schemes, which cover different forms of abusive behavior, at the same time. We propose an incremental and iterative methodology, that utilizes the power of crowdsourcing to annotate a large scale collection of tweets with a set of abuse-related labels. In fact, by applying our methodology including statistical analysis for label merging or elimination, we identify a reduced but robust set of labels. Finally, we offer a first overview and findings of our collected and annotated dataset of 100 thousand tweets, which we make publicly available for further scientific exploration.</p>

%T Class-based Prediction Errors to Categorize Text with Out-of-vocabulary Words

%X <p>Common approaches to text categorization essentially rely either on n-gram counts or on word embeddings. This presents important difficulties in highly dynamic or quickly-interacting environments, where the appearance of new words and/or varied misspellings is the norm. A paradigmatic example of this situation is abusive online behavior, with social networks and media platforms struggling to effectively combat uncommon or non-blacklisted hate words. To better deal with these issues in those fast-paced environments, we propose using the error signal of class-based language models as input to text classification algorithms. In particular, we train a next-character prediction model for any given class, and then exploit the error of such class-based models to inform a neural network classifier. This way, we shift from the ability to describe seen documents to the ability to predict unseen content. Preliminary studies using out-of-vocabulary splits from abusive tweet data show promising results, outperforming competitive text categorization strategies by 4–11%.</p>

%T Hate is not Binary: Studying Abusive Behavior of #GamerGate on Twitter

%X <p>Over the past few years, online bullying and aggression have become increasingly prominent, and manifested in many different forms on social media. However, there is little work analyzing the characteristics of abusive users and what distinguishes them from typical social media users. In this paper, we start addressing this gap by analyzing tweets containing a great amount of abusiveness. We focus on a Twitter dataset revolving around the Gamergate controversy, which led to many incidents of cyberbullying and cyberaggression on various gaming and social media platforms. We study the properties of the users tweeting about Gamergate, the content they post, and the differences in their behavior compared to typical Twitter users.</p>    <p>We find that while their tweets are often seemingly about aggressive and hateful subjects, ``Gamergaters'' do not exhibit common expressions of online anger, and in fact primarily differ from typical users in that their tweets are less joyful. They are also more engaged than typical Twitter users, which is an indication as to how and why this controversy is still ongoing. Surprisingly, we find that Gamergaters are less likely to be suspended by Twitter, thus we analyze their properties to identify differences from typical users and what may have led to their suspension. We perform an unsupervised machine learning analysis to detect clusters of users who, though currently active, could be considered for suspension since they exhibit similar behaviors with suspended users. Finally, we confirm the usefulness of our analyzed features by emulating the Twitter suspension mechanism with a supervised learning method, achieving very good precision and recall.</p>

%X <p>In recent years, bullying and aggression against users on social media have grown significantly, causing serious consequences to victims of all demographics. In particular, cyberbullying affects more than half of young social media users worldwide, and has also led to teenage suicides, prompted by prolonged and/or coordinated digital harassment. Nonetheless, tools and technologies for understanding and mitigating it are scarce and mostly ineffective. In this paper, we present a principled and scalable approach to detect bullying and aggressive behavior on Twitter. We propose a robust methodology for extracting text, user, and network-based attributes, studying the properties of cyberbullies and aggressors, and what features distinguish them from regular users. We find that bully users post less, participate in fewer online communities, and are less popular than normal users, while aggressors are quite popular and tend to include more negativity in their posts. We evaluate our methodology using a corpus of 1.6M tweets posted over 3 months, and show that machine learning classification algorithms can accurately detect users exhibiting bullying and aggressive behavior, achieving over 90% AUC.</p>

%X <p>Over the past few years, online aggression and abusive behaviors have occurred in many different forms and on a variety of platforms. In extreme cases, these incidents have evolved into hate, discrimination, and bullying, and even materialized into real-world threats and attacks against individuals or groups. In this paper, we study the Gamergate controversy. Started in August 2014 in the online gaming world, it quickly spread across various social networking platforms, ultimately leading to many incidents of cyberbullying and cyberaggression. We focus on Twitter, presenting a measurement study of a dataset of 340k unique users and 1.6M tweets to study the properties of these users, the content they post, and how they differ from random Twitter users. We find that users involved in this "Twitter war" tend to have more friends and followers, are generally more engaged and post tweets with negative sentiment, less joy, and more hate than random users. We also perform preliminary measurements on how the Twitter suspension mechanism deals with such abusive behaviors. While we focus on Gamergate, our methodology to collect and analyze tweets related to aggressive and bullying activities is of independent interest.</p>

%X <p>Abstract Sentiment analysis and opinion mining are valuable for extraction of useful subjective information out of text documents. These tasks have become of great importance, especially for business and marketing professionals, since online posted products and services reviews impact markets and consumers shifts. This work is motivated by the fact that automating retrieval and detection of sentiments expressed for certain products and services embeds complex processes and pose research challenges, due to the textual phenomena and the language specific expression variations. This paper proposes a fast, flexible, generic methodology for sentiment detection out of textual snippets which express people’s opinions in different languages. The proposed methodology adopts a machine learning approach with which textual documents are represented by vectors and are used for training a polarity classification model. Several documents’ vector representation approaches have been studied, including lexicon-based, word embedding-based and hybrid vectorizations. The competence of these feature representations for the sentiment classification task is assessed through experiments on four datasets containing online user reviews in both Greek and English languages, in order to represent high and weak inflection language groups. The proposed methodology requires minimal computational resources, thus, it might have impact in real world scenarios where limited resources is the case.</p>

%X <p>We present an approach for detecting concepts in images bya graph-based semi-supervised learning scheme. The proposed approach builds a similarity graph between both the labeled and unlabeled images of the collection and uses the Laplacian Eigemaps of the graph as features for training concept detectors. Therefore, it offers multiple options for fusing different image features. In addition, we present an incremental learning scheme that, given a set of new unlabeled images, efficiently performs the computation of the Laplacian Eigenmaps. We evaluate the performance of our approach both on synthetic datasets and on MIR Flickr, comparing it with high-performance state-of-the-art learning schemes with competitive and in some cases superior results.</p>

Since millions of usersshare opinions on different aspects of life everyday, microblogging websites are considered as a credible source for exploring both factual and subjective information. This fact has inspired research in the area of automatic sentiment analysis. In this paper we propose an emotional aware clustering approach which performs sentiment analysis of users tweets onthe basis of an emotional dictionary and groups tweets according to the degree they express a specific set of emotions. Experimental evaluations on datasets derived from Twitter prove the efficiency of the proposed approach.</p>

We model fullcompletion as a frequent sequence mining problem and weshow how existing algorithms can be applied in this context.To overcome some limitations of the frequent sequence miningalgorithms, e.g., efficiency and recommendation granularity,we propose FESMA, a new and efficient algorithm for computingfrequent sequences of services and recommending completions.FESMA also integrates a social dimension, extractedfrom the transformation of user ? service interactions intouser ? user interactions, building an implicit graph thathelps to better predict completions of services in a fashiontailored to individual users. Evaluations show that FESMAis more efficient outperforming the existing algorithms evenwith the consideration of the social dimension. Our proposalhas been implemented in a prototype, SoCo, developed at BellLabs.</p>

%X <p>Due to the gradual and rapid increase in Information andCommunication Technology (ICT) industry, it is very important to introduce energy efficient techniques and infrastructures in large scale distributed systems. Content Distribution Networks (CDNs) are one of these popular systems which try to make the contents closer to the widely dispersed Internet users. A Content Distribution Network provides its services by using a number of surrogate servers geographicallydistributed in the web. Surrogate servers have the copies of the original contents belonging to the origin server, depending on their storage capacity.When a client requests for some particular contents from a surrogateserver, either this request can be fulfilled directly by it or in case of absence of the requested contents, surrogate servers cooperate with eachother or with the origin server. In this paper, our focus is on the surrogate servers utilization and using it as a parameter to conserve energy in CDNs while trying to maintain an acceptable Quality of Experience (QoE).</p>

%X <p>Content Distribution Networks (CDNs) have gained considerable attention in the past few years.As such, there is need for developing frameworks for carrying out CDN simulations. In this paper,we present a modeling and simulation framework for CDNs, called CDNsim. CDNsim hasbeen designated to provide a realistic simulation for CDNs, simulating the surrogate servers, theTCP/IP protocol and the main CDN functions. The main advantages of this tool are its high performance,its extensibility and its user interface which is used to configure its parameters. CDNsimprovides an automated environment for conducting experiments and extracting client, server andnetwork statistics. The purpose of CDNsim is to be used as a testbed for CDN evaluation andexperimentation. This is quite useful both for the research community (to experiment with newCDN data management techniques) and for CDN developers (to evaluate profits on prior certainCDN installations).</p>

%X <p>We present a technical demonstration of an online city explorationapplication that helps users identify interesting spotsin a city by use of photo clusters corresponding to landmarksand events. Our application, called ClustTour, is based onan efficient landmark and event detection scheme for taggedphoto collections. The proposed scheme relies on the combinationof a graph-based photo clustering algorithm, makinguse of both visual and tag information of photos, with acluster classification and merging module. ClustTour createsa map-based visualization of the identified photo clustersthat are classified in prominent categories and are filterableby time and tag. We believe that such an applicationcan greatly facilitate the task of knowing a city through itslandmarks and events. So far, the demo has been based on alarge photo dataset focused on Barcelona, and it is graduallyexpanding to contain photo clusters of several major cities ofEurope. Furthermore, an Android application is developedthat complements the web-based version of ClustTour.</p>

In this paper, an approach for improving the retrieval in these systems, in case of ambiguous terms, is presented that attempts to perform tag disambiguation and, at the same time, provide users with relevant content. The idea is based on a mashup that combines data and functionality of two major web 2.0 sites, namely Flickr and Wikipedia and aims at enhancing content retrieval for web users. A case study with the ambiguous notion â€śAppleâ€ť illustrates the value of the proposed approach.</p>

In this context, designers andmanufacturers communicate for the manufacturing of a workpiece, under a platform-independent, easier,faster and more economical way. The proposed framework is implemented as a web service, wherethe Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) is used for the exchange of the necessary machined parts dataand the methodologies of UDDI (Universal Description Discovery and Integration) and WSDL (Web ServicesDescription Language) are introduced for providing directories and descriptions information.</p>

%X <p>Content distribution networks (CDNs) balance costs and quality in services related to content delivery. Devising an efficientcontent outsourcing policy is crucial since, based on such policies, CDN providers can provide client-tailored content, improveperformance, and result in significant economical gains. Earlier content outsourcing approaches may often prove ineffective since theydrive prefetching decisions by assuming knowledge of content popularity statistics, which are not always available and are extremelyvolatile. This work addresses this issue, by proposing a novel self-adaptive technique under a CDN framework on which outsourcedcontent is identified with no a priori knowledge of (earlier) request statistics. This is employed by using a structure-based approachidentifying coherent clusters of â€ścorrelatedâ€ť Web server content objects, the so-called Web page communities. These communities arethe core outsourcing unit, and in this paper, a detailed simulation experimentation has shown that the proposed technique is robust andeffective in reducing user-perceived latency as compared with competing approaches, i.e., two communities-based approaches, Webcaching, and non-CDN.</p>

Inthe literature, a wide range of techniques has been developed,implemented and standardized for improving the performanceof CDNs. The ultimate goal of all the approachesis to improve the utility of CDN surrogate servers. In thispaper we define a metric which measures the utility of CDNsurrogate servers, called CDN utility. This metric capturesthe traffic activity in a CDN, expressing the usefulness ofsurrogate servers in terms of data circulation in the network.Through an extensive simulation testbed, we identifythe parameters that affect the CDN utility in such infrastructures.We evaluate the utility of surrogate servers undervarious parameters and provide insightful comments.</p>

%X <p>A huge amount of data is circulated and collected every dayon a regular time basis. Given a pair of such datasets, it might be possibleto reveal hidden dependencies between them since the presence of the onedataset elements may influence the elements of the other dataset and viceversa. Furthermore, the impact of these relations may last during a periodinstead of the time point of their co-occurrence. Mining such relationsunder those assumptions is a challenging problem. In this paper, we studytwo time-related datasets whose elements are bilaterally affected overtime. We employ a co-clustering approach to identify groups of similarelements on the basis of two distinct criteria: the direction and durationof their impact. The proposed approach is evaluated using time-relatednews and stockâ€™s market real datasets.</p>

%X <p>Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) provide an efficient support for serving â€śresourcehungryâ€ťapplications while minimizing the network impact of content delivery as well asshifting the traffic away from overloaded origin servers. However, their performance gain islimited since the storage space in CDNâ€™s servers is not used optimally. In order to managetheir storage capacity in an efficient way, we integrate caching techniques in CDNs. Thechallenge is to decide which objects would be devoted to caching so as the CDNâ€™s server maybe used both as a replicator and as a proxy server. In this paper we propose a nonlinear nonparametricmodel which classifies the CDNâ€™s server cache into two parts. Through a detailedsimulation environment, we show that the proposed technique can yield significant reductionin user-perceived latency as compared with other heuristic schemes.</p>

%X <p>LDAP directories have rapidly emerged as the essentialframework for storing a wide range of heterogeneous information undervarious applications and services. Increasing amounts of informationare being stored in LDAP directories imposing the need for efficientdata organization and retrieval. In this paper, we propose the LPAIR&amp; LMERGE (LP-LM) hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithmfor improving LDAP data organization. LP-LM merges a pair of clustersat each step, considering the LD-vectors, which represent the entriesâ€™structure. The clustering-based LDAP data organization enhances LDAPserverâ€™s response times, under a specific query framework.</p>

In this paper we introduce acredential-based access control framework for protecting XML resources. Underthis framework, we propose the use of access policy files containing policiesconcerning a specific credentials type. Moreover, we propose the reorganizationof the policies in these files based on their frequency of use (the morefrequently it is used the higher in the file it is placed). Our main goal is to improverequest servicing times. Several experiments have been conducted whichare carried out either on single request or on multiple requests base. The proposedframework is proven quite beneficial for protecting XML-based frameworkssuch as digital libraries or any other data resources whose format is expressedin XML.</p>

In practice, caching and replicationtechniques have been applied in proxy servers and Content DistributionNetworks (CDNs) respectively. In this paper, we investigate the benefits of integratingcaching policies on a CDNâ€™ s infrastructure. Using a simulation testbed,our results indicate that there is much room for performance improvement interms of perceived latency, hit ratio and byte hit ratio. Moreover, we show thatthe combination of caching with replication fortifies CDNs against flash crowdevents.</p>

In this paper, we present a cache replacementalgorithm (so-called FRES-CAR), which identifies theobjects that should be evicted by considering togetherthree important criteria: objectâ€™s frequency, recency andsize.

%X <p>The rapid increase on the circulation of data over the web has highlightedthe need for distributed storage of Internet-accessible information due tothe rapid increase on the circulation of data over the web. Thus, access controlmechanisms should also be distributed in order to protect them effectively. A recentidea in the access control theory is the delegation and revocation of rights,i.e. the passing over of one clients rights to the other and vice versa. Here, wepropose an XML-based distributed delegation module which can be integratedinto a distributed role-based access control mechanism protecting networks. Theidea of X.509v3 certificates is used for the transfer of authorization informationreferring to a client. The modules are XML-based and all of the associated datastructures are expressed through Document Type Definitions (DTDs).</p>
