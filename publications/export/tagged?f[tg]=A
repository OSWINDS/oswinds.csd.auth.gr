%X <p>In this paper we present a web mining tool which automaticallyextracts the structure, content and usage data statistics of websites. This work inspired by the fact that web mining consists ofthree axes: web structure mining, web content mining and webusage mining. Each one of those axes is using the structure,content and usage data respectively. The scope is to use thedeveloped multi-thread web crawler as a tool to automaticallyextract from web pages data that are associated with each one ofthose three axes in order afterwards to compute several usefuldescriptive statistics and apply advanced mathematical andstatistical methods. A description of our system is provided aswell as some experimentation results.</p>

%X <p>The rapid evolution of the web has affected the way under which the manufacturing process is practised.In this paper, a web based framework â€“ independent from any specific CAD/CAM software â€“ is proposed,for employing electronic interaction between designers and manufacturers. In this context, designers andmanufacturers communicate for the manufacturing of a workpiece, under a platform-independent, easier,faster and more economical way. The proposed framework is implemented as a web service, wherethe Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) is used for the exchange of the necessary machined parts dataand the methodologies of UDDI (Universal Description Discovery and Integration) and WSDL (Web ServicesDescription Language) are introduced for providing directories and descriptions information.</p>

%T Assigning Gene Ontology terms to biotext by classification methods
%X <p>Biomedical literature databases constitute valuable repositories of up to date scientificknowledge. The development of efficient classification methods in order to facilitate theorganization of these databases and the extraction of novel biomedical knowledge is becomingincreasingly important. Several of these methods use bio-ontologies, like Gene Ontology toconcisely describe and classify biological documents. The purpose of this paper is to comparetwo classical statistical classification methods, namely multinomial logistic regression (MLR)and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), to a machine learning classification method, calledsupport vector machines (SVM). Although all the methods have been used with success forclassifying texts, there is not a direct comparison between them for classifying biological textto specific Gene Ontology terms. The results from the study show that LDA performs better(accuracy 80.32%) than SVM (77.18%) and MLR (57.4%). LDA not only performs well inthe assignment of Gene Ontology terms to documents, but also reduces the dimensions of theoriginal data, making them easier to manage.</p>

%T An Adaptive Model for Parallel I/O Processing
%X <p>Modern I/O subsystems have increased capacity and density but their performance has not been improved accordingly. To address this problem we have developed a new model that is based on feedback information provided to the I/O subsystem controller. The presented model is applied to a multiple disk drive subsystem which serves requests in parallel. Under conventional servicing, each request refers to a specific drive and is placed on the corresponding disk drive queue in order to be serviced. The proposed feedback-based model redirects requests among disk drives towards performance gain. The feedback is evaluated by a metric identified by the queue length per disk drive. The request servicing in a parallel disk drive subsystem is simulated and simulation runs measure both conventional and feedback-based servicing. The simulation results validate the presented model and prove that it shows an important improvement in both seek and servicing times compared with the conventional request servicing models.</p>
