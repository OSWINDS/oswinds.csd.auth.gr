	title = {A fuzzy bi-clustering approach to correlate web users and pages},
	year = {2009},
	abstract = {<p>With the rapid development of information technology, thesignificance of clustering in the process of delivering information to users isbecoming more eminent. Especially in the web information space, clusteringanalysis can prove particularly beneficial for a variety of applications such asweb personalisation and profiling, caching and prefetching and content deliverynetworks. In this paper, we propose a bi-clustering approach, which identifiesgroups of related web users and pages. The proposed approach is a three-stepprocess that relies on the principles of spectral clustering analysis and providesa fuzzy relation scheme for the revealed users{\textquoteright} and pages{\textquoteright} clusters. Experimentshave been conducted on both synthetic and real datasets to prove the proposedmethod{\textquoteright}s efficiency and reveal hidden knowledge.</p>

This work presents a novel FLR extension, namely agglomerative similarity measure FLR, orasmFLR for short, for clustering based on a similarity measure function, the latter (function) may also bebased on a metric. We demonstrate application in a metric space emerging from a weighted graphtowards partitioning it. The asmFLR compares favorably with four alternative graph-clusteringalgorithms from the literature in a series of computational experiments on artificial data. In addition,our work introduces a novel index for the quality of clustering, which (index) compares favorably withtwo popular indices from the literature.</p>
