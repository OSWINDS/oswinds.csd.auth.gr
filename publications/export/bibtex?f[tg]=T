	title = {Towards a user-aware virtual museum},
	year = {2011},
	abstract = {<p>The exploration of cultural heritage through welldesignedvirtual worlds has met an increase in popularity withinthe last decade. More and more well-known museums aroundthe globe have started to spend funds in order to build systemswith which users can virtually navigate through the museums{\textquoteright}exhibits. Technological breakthroughs in graphics design and theuse of multimedia content have helped these systems becomemore attractive and easier to use. However, the vast majority ofthese systems are solely there to represent content in an appealingway, with users just having the submissive role of requestinginformation. In this paper, we want to make one step furtherand present a user-aware system for virtual museums. Usersin the proposed system are active users who can express theiropinions in many different ways, enabling us to extract userpreferences on cultural content. We follow a group-based logicin order to capture the underlying differences in user preferencesbetween the groups. We believe that these findings are beneficialfor providing a better user experience and, also, for the museum{\textquoteright}sadministrators who can easily assess user interest about themuseum by analyzing their evaluations.</p>

	title = {Time Aware Web Users Clustering},
	year = {2009},
	abstract = {<p>Web users clustering is a crucial task for mininginformation related to users needs and preferences. Up to now,popular clustering approaches build clusters based on usagepatterns derived from users{\textquoteright} page preferences. This paper emphasizesthe need to discover similarities in users{\textquoteright} accessing behaviorwith respect to the time locality of their navigational acts. Inthis context, we present two time aware clustering approachesfor tuning and binding the page and time visiting criteria. Thetwo tracks of the proposed algorithms define clusters with usersthat show similar visiting behavior at the same time period, byvarying the priority given to page or time visiting. The proposedalgorithms are evaluated using both synthetic and real datasetsand the experimentation has shown that the new clusteringschemes result in enriched clusters compared to those createdby the conventional non-time aware users clustering approaches.These clusters contain users exhibiting similar access behaviornot only in terms of their page preferences but also of their accesstime.</p>
