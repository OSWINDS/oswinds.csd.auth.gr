	abstract = {<p>Smart city infrastructures provide unique opportunities for innovative applications developing and testing. Sensor city installations offer the ground for experimenting with user-oriented services, which at the same time can test and improve the infrastructure itself. The proposed work summarizes principles and methodology for and experiment, entitled SEN2SOC which will bridge sensor measurements and social networks interactions via natural language generation for supporting smart city services. SEN2SOC aims at exploiting the SmartSantander infrastructure in a sensor to social reciprocal fashion such that the sensor measurements will be and communicated to the public (citizens,authorities, etc), while social networks users activities in relevance to sensors social postings will be analyzed and summarized both to verify sensors reporting and to develop collective aware applications.</p>

This work inspired by the fact that web mining consists ofthree axes: web structure mining, web content mining and webusage mining. Each one of those axes is using the structure,content and usage data respectively. The scope is to use thedeveloped multi-thread web crawler as a tool to automaticallyextract from web pages data that are associated with each one ofthose three axes in order afterwards to compute several usefuldescriptive statistics and apply advanced mathematical andstatistical methods. A description of our system is provided aswell as some experimentation results.</p>

A critical issue inthe assignment of functions to genes is the utilizationof knowledge from published biomedical articles. Thepurpose of this paper is to present a unified andcomprehensive statistical methodology for functionallyannotating genes using biomedical literature.Specifically, classification models are built using thediscriminant analysis method while validation,analysis and interpretation of the results is based ongraphical methods and various performance metricsand techniques. The general conclusions from thestudy are very promising, in the sense that theproposed methodology not only performs well in theassignment of functions to genes, but also providesuseful and interpretable results regarding thediscriminating power of certain keywords in the texts.},

Standard approaches, such as clusteringof users{\^a}{\texteuro}{\texttrademark}sessions and discovering association rules or frequent navigational paths,do not generally allow to characterize or quantify the unobservable factors that leadto common navigational patterns. Therefore, it is necessary to develop techniquesthat can discover hidden and useful relationships among users as well as betweenusers and Web objects.Correspondence Analysis(CO-AN) is particularly useful inthis context, since it can uncover meaningful associations among users and pages.We present a model-based cluster analysis for Web users sessions including anovel visualization and interpretation approach which is based on CO-AN.},

Web proxy servershave an important role in reducing server loads, networktraffic, and client request latencies. This paper presentsa detailed workload characterization study of a busyWeb proxy server. The study aims in identifying themajor characteristics which will improve modelling ofWeb proxy accessing. A set of log files is processed forworkload characterization. Throughout the study,emphasis is given on identifying the criteria for a Webcaching model. A statistical analysis, based on theprevious criteria, is presented in order to characterizethe major workload parameters. Results of this analysisare presented and the paper concludes with a discussionabout workload characterization and content deliveryissues.</p>
