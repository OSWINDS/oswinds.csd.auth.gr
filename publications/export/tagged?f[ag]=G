%X <p>Abstract Sentiment analysis and opinion mining are valuable for extraction of useful subjective information out of text documents. These tasks have become of great importance, especially for business and marketing professionals, since online posted products and services reviews impact markets and consumers shifts. This work is motivated by the fact that automating retrieval and detection of sentiments expressed for certain products and services embeds complex processes and pose research challenges, due to the textual phenomena and the language specific expression variations. This paper proposes a fast, flexible, generic methodology for sentiment detection out of textual snippets which express people’s opinions in different languages. The proposed methodology adopts a machine learning approach with which textual documents are represented by vectors and are used for training a polarity classification model. Several documents’ vector representation approaches have been studied, including lexicon-based, word embedding-based and hybrid vectorizations. The competence of these feature representations for the sentiment classification task is assessed through experiments on four datasets containing online user reviews in both Greek and English languages, in order to represent high and weak inflection language groups. The proposed methodology requires minimal computational resources, thus, it might have impact in real world scenarios where limited resources is the case.</p>

%X <p>Social networking data threads emerge rapidly and such crowd-driven big data streams are valuable for detecting trends and opinions. For such analytics, conventional data mining approaches are challenged by both high-dimensionality and scalability concerns. Here, we leverage on the Cloud4Trends framework, for collecting and analyzing geo-located microblogging content, partitioned into clusters under cloud-based infrastructures. Different cloud architectures are proposed to offer flexible solutions for geo-located data analytics, with emphasis on incremental trend analysis. The proposed architectures are largely based on a set of service modules which facilitate the deployment of the experimentation on Cloud infrastructures. Several experimentation remarks are highlighted to showcase the requirements and testing capabilities of different cloud computing settings.</p>

%X <p>With the emerging and intense use of Online Social Networks (OSNs) amongst young children and teenagers (youngters), safe networking and socializing on the Web has faced extensive scrutiny. Content and interactions which are considered safe for adult OSN users, might embed potentially threatening and malicious information when it comes to underage users. This work is motivated by the strong need to safeguard youngsters OSNs experience such that they can be empowered and aware. The topology of a graph is studied towards detecting the so called social bridges, i.e. the group(s) of malicious users and their supporters, who have links and ties to both honest and malicious user communities. A graph-topology based classification scheme is proposed to detect such bridge linkages which are suspicious for threatening youngsters networking vulnerability. The proposed scheme is validated by a Twitter network, at which potentially dangerous users are identified based on their Twitter connections. The achieved performance is higher compared to previous efforts, despite the increased complexity due to the variety of groups identified as malicious.</p>

%A Maria Giatsoglou

%A Athena Vakali
%X <p>In social media, users' interactions are affected by real-world events which influence emergence and shifts of opinions and topics. Interactions around an event-related topic can be captured in a weighted network, while identification of connectivity and intensity patterns can improve understanding of users' interest on the topic. Community detection is studied here as a means to reveal groups of social media users with common interaction patterns in such networks. The proposed community detection approach identifies communities exploiting both structural properties and intensity patterns, while dynamics of communities' evolution around an event are revealed based on an iterative community detection and mapping scheme. We investigate the importance of considering interactions' intensity for community detection via a benchmarking process on synthetic graphs and propose a generic framework for: i) modeling user interactions, ii) identifying static and evolving communities around events, iii) extracting quantitative and qualitative measurements from the communities' timeline, iv) leveraging measurements to understand the events' impact. Two real-world case studies based on Twitter interactions demonstrate the framework's potential for capturing and interpreting associations among communities and events.</p>

%X <p>Multimedia data indexing for content-based retrieval has attractedsignificant attention in recent years due to the commoditizationof multimedia capturing equipment and the widespread adoption of social networking platforms as means for sharing media content online. Due to the very large amounts of multimedia content, notably images, produced and shared online by people, a very important requirement for multimedia indexing approaches pertains to their efficiency both in terms of computation and memory usage. A common approach to support query-by-example image search is based on the extraction of visual words from images and their indexing by means of inverted indices, a method proposed and popularized in the field of text retrieval.The main challenge that visual word indexing systems currently facearises from the fact that it is necessary to build very large visual vocabularies (hundreds of thousands or even millions of words) to support sufficiently precise search. However, when the visual vocabulary is large,the image indexing process becomes computationally expensive due to the fact that the local image descriptors (e.g. SIFT) need to be quantized to the nearest visual words.To this end, this paper proposes a novel method that significantly decreases the time required for the above quantization process. Instead of using hundreds of thousands of visual words for quantization, the proposed method manages to preserve retrieval quality by using a much smaller number of words for indexing. This is achieved by the concept of composite words, i.e. assigning multiple words to a local descriptor in ascending order of distance. We evaluate the proposed method in the Oxford and Paris buildings datasets to demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach.</p>

%X <p>We present an approach for detecting concepts in images bya graph-based semi-supervised learning scheme. The proposed approach builds a similarity graph between both the labeled and unlabeled images of the collection and uses the Laplacian Eigemaps of the graph as features for training concept detectors. Therefore, it offers multiple options for fusing different image features. In addition, we present an incremental learning scheme that, given a set of new unlabeled images, efficiently performs the computation of the Laplacian Eigenmaps. We evaluate the performance of our approach both on synthetic datasets and on MIR Flickr, comparing it with high-performance state-of-the-art learning schemes with competitive and in some cases superior results.</p>

Sensor city installations offer the ground for experimenting with user-oriented services, which at the same time can test and improve the infrastructure itself. The proposed work summarizes principles and methodology for and experiment, entitled SEN2SOC which will bridge sensor measurements and social networks interactions via natural language generation for supporting smart city services. SEN2SOC aims at exploiting the SmartSantander infrastructure in a sensor to social reciprocal fashion such that the sensor measurements will be and communicated to the public (citizens,authorities, etc), while social networks users activities in relevance to sensors social postings will be analyzed and summarized both to verify sensors reporting and to develop collective aware applications.</p>

%X <p>The common ground behind most approaches that analyze social taggingsystems is addressing the information challenge that emerges from the massiveactivity of millions of users who interact and share resources and/or metadata online.However, lack of any time-related data in the analysis process implicitly deniesmuch of the dynamic nature of social tagging activity. In this paper we claim thatholding a temporal dimension, allows for tracking macroscopic and microscopicusersâ€™ interests, detecting emerging trends and recognizing events. To this end, wepropose a time-aware co-clustering approach for acquiring semantic and temporalpatterns out of the tagging activity. The resulted clusters contain both users and tagsof similar patterns over time, and reveal non-obvious or â€śhiddenâ€ť relations amongusers and topics of their common interest. Zoom in &amp; out views serve as visualizationmethods on different aspects of the clustersâ€™ structure, in order to evaluate theefficiency of the approach.</p>

Since millions of usersshare opinions on different aspects of life everyday, microblogging websites are considered as a credible source for exploring both factual and subjective information. This fact has inspired research in the area of automatic sentiment analysis. In this paper we propose an emotional aware clustering approach which performs sentiment analysis of users tweets onthe basis of an emotional dictionary and groups tweets according to the degree they express a specific set of emotions. Experimental evaluations on datasets derived from Twitter prove the efficiency of the proposed approach.</p>

%X <p>Tagging environments have become an interesting topic ofresearch lately, focused mainly on clustering approaches, inorder to extract emergent patterns that are derived from tagsimilarity and involve tag relations or user interconnections.Apart from tag similarity, an interesting parameter to be analyzedduring the clustering/mining process in such data isthe actual time that each tagging activity occurred. Indeed,holding a temporal dimension unfolds macroscopic and microscopicviews of tagging, highlights links between objectsfor specific time periods and, in general, lets us observe howthe usersâ€™ tagging activity changes over time. In this article,we propose a time-aware user/tag clustering approach, whichgroups together similar users and tags that are very â€śactiveâ€ťduring the same time periods. Emphasis is given on usingvarying time scales, so that we distinguish between clustersthat are robust at many time scales and clusters that are somehowoccasional, i.e. they emerge, only at a specific time period.</p>

%X <p>Given the popularity of social tagging systems and the limitationsthese systems have, due to lack of any structure, a common issue that arises involves the low retrieval quality in such systems due to ambiguities of certain terms. In this paper, an approach for improving the retrieval in these systems, in case of ambiguous terms, is presented that attempts to perform tag disambiguation and, at the same time, provide users with relevant content. The idea is based on a mashup that combines data and functionality of two major web 2.0 sites, namely Flickr and Wikipedia and aims at enhancing content retrieval for web users. A case study with the ambiguous notion â€śAppleâ€ť illustrates the value of the proposed approach.</p>

%X <p>Under Social Tagging Systems, a typical Web 2.0 application,users label digital data sources by using freely chosen textual descriptions(tags). Mining tag information reveals the topic-domain ofusers interests and significantly contributes in a profile construction process.In this paper we propose a clustering framework which groups usersaccording to their preferred topics and the time locality of their taggingactivity. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposedapproach which results in more enriched time-aware users profiles.</p>

%X <p>Under social tagging systems, a typical Web 2.0 application,users label digital data sources by using freely chosentextual descriptions (tags). Poor retrieval in the aforementionedsystems remains a major problem mostly due toquestionable tag validity and tag ambiguity. Earlier clusteringtechniques have shown limited improvements, since theywere based mostly on tag co-occurrences. In this paper,a co-clustering approach is employed, that exploits jointgroups of related tags and social data sources, in whichboth social and semantic aspects of tags are consideredsimultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate the effi-ciency and the beneficial outcome of the proposed approachin correlating relevant tags and resources.</p>

%X Clustering web users based on their access patterns is a quite significanttask in Web Usage Mining. Further to clustering it is important to evaluatethe resulted clusters in order to choose the best clustering for a particular framework.This paper examines the usage of Kullback-Leibler divergence, aninformation theoretic distance, in conjuction with the k-means clusteringalgorithm. It compares KL-divergence with other well known distance measures(Euclidean, Standardized Euclidean and Manhattan) and evaluates clusteringresults using both objective functionâ€™s value and Davies-Bouldin index.Since it is imperative to assess whether the results of a clustering process aresusceptible to noise, especially in noisy environments such as Web environment,our approach takes the impact of noise into account. The clusters obtainedwith KL approach seem to be superior to those obtained with the otherdistance measures in case our data have been corrupted by noise.

%X <p>Web caching and content replication techniques emergedto solve performance problems related to the Web. We proposea generic non-parametric heuristic method that integratesboth techniques under a CDN. We provide experimentationshowing that our method outperforms the so farseparate implementations of Web caching and content replication.Moreover, we show that the performance improvementcompared with an existing algorithm is significant. Wetest all these techniques in a simulation environment undera flash crowd event and a workload of a typical lightweightedCDN operation.</p>

%X In our project, we adopt a new approach for handlingvideo data. We view the video as a well-defined datatype with its own description, parameters, and applicablemethods. The system is based on PREDATOR, the opensource object relational DBMS. PREDATOR uses Shoreas the underlying storage manager (SM). Supporting videooperations (storing, searching by content, and streaming)and new query types (query by examples and multi-featuressimilarity search) requires major changes in many ofthe traditional system components. More specifically,the storage and buffer manager will have to deal withhuge volumes of data with real time constraints. Queryprocessing has to consider the video methods and operatorsin generating, optimizing and executing query plans.
