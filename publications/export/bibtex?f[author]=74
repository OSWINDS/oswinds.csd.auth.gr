	abstract = {<p>Events constitute a significant means of multimedia content organizationand sharing. Despite the recent interest in detecting events and annotating mediacontent in an event-centric way, there is currently insufficient support for managingevents in large-scale content collections and limited understanding of the eventannotation process. To this end, this paper presents CrEve, a collaborative eventannotation framework which uses content found in social media sites with theprime objective to facilitate the annotation of large media corpora with eventinformation. The proposed annotation framework could significantly benefit socialmedia research due to the proliferation of event-related user-contributed content.We demonstrate that, compared to a standard {\^a}{\texteuro}{\'s}browse-and-annotate{\^a}{\texteuro}{\v t} interface,CrEve leads to a 19\% increase in the coverage of the generated ground truth in alarge-scale annotation experiment. Furthermore, the paper discusses the results of auser study that quantifies the performance of CrEve and the contribution of differentevent dimensions in the event annotation process. The study confirms the prevalenceof spatio-temporal queries as the prime option of discovering event-related contentin a large collection. In addition, textual queries and social cues (content contributor) were also found to be significant as event search dimensions. Finally, it demonstratesthe potential of employing automatic photo clustering methods with the goal offacilitating event annotation.</p>

The proposed approach builds a similarity graph between both the labeled and unlabeled images of the collection and uses the Laplacian Eigemaps of the graph as features for training concept detectors. Therefore, it offers multiple options for fusing different image features. In addition, we present an incremental learning scheme that, given a set of new unlabeled images, efficiently performs the computation of the Laplacian Eigenmaps. We evaluate the performance of our approach both on synthetic datasets and on MIR Flickr, comparing it with high-performance state-of-the-art learning schemes with competitive and in some cases superior results.</p>

In this paper we claim thatholding a temporal dimension, allows for tracking macroscopic and microscopicusers{\^a}{\texteuro}{\texttrademark} interests, detecting emerging trends and recognizing events.

However, tags suffer from severallimitations{\^a}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblright}such as polysemy, lack of uniformity,and spam{\^a}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblright}thus not presenting an adequatesolution to the problem of contentorganization. Therefore, automated contentorganizationmethods are of particular importanceto improve the content-consumptionexperience. Because it{\^a}{\texteuro}{\texttrademark}s common for users to associatetheir photo-captured experiences withsome landmarks{\^a}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblright}for example, a tourist site oran event, such as a music concert or a gatheringwith friends{\^a}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblright}we can view landmarks andevents as natural units of organization forlarge image collections. It{\^a}{\texteuro}{\texttrademark}s for this reasonthat automating the process of detecting suchconcepts in large image sets can enhance theexperience of accessing massive amounts ofpictorial content.In this article, we present a novel scheme forautomatically detecting landmarks and eventsin tagged image collections. Our proposal isbased on the simple yet elegant concept ofimage similarity graphs as a means of combiningmultiple notions of similarity betweenimages in a photo collection; in our case, weuse visual and tag similarity. We perform clusteringon such image similarity graphs bymeans of community detection,1 a processthat identifies on the graph groups of nodesthat are more densely connected to eachother than to the rest of the network. In contrastto conventional clustering schemes suchas k-means or hierarchical agglomerative clustering,community detection is computationallymore efficient and doesn{\^a}{\texteuro}{\texttrademark}t require thenumber of clusters to be provided as input. Subsequently,we classify the resulting image clustersas landmarks or events by use of featuresrelated to the temporal, social, and tag characteristicsof image clusters. In the case of landmarks,we also conduct a cluster-merging stepon the basis of spatial proximity to enrich ourlandmark model.</p>

Until recently,the decision on what content to display in a publisher{\^a}{\texteuro}{\texttrademark}s web pages was made by one or at most fewauthorities. In contrast, modern SBS-based applications permit their users to submit their preferredcontent, to comment on and to rate the content of other users and establish social relations witheach other. In that way, the vision of the social media is realized, i.e. the online users collectivelydecide upon the interestingness of the available bookmarked content. This article attempts to provideinsights into the dynamics emerging from the process of content rating by the user community.To this end, the article proposes a framework for the study of the statistical properties of an SBS,the evolution of bookmarked content popularity and user activity in time, as well as the impact ofonline social networks on the content consumption behavior of individuals.
