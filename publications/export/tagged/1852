%T A QoS-based Disk Subsystem
%X <p>QoS has been proposed in storage subsystem management towards eective disk space utilization andrequest servicing We present a QoS based storage model for eective user negotiation in terms ofscheduling and the number of storage devices A simulation model is developed based on an available disksimulator which is experimented under articial request workload towards better systems responsiveness performance and functionality Certain remarksand conclusions are raised with respect to the simulated scheduling algorithms and the capacity availableto the clients environment.</p>
