%T A Two-Level Representation Model for Effective Video Data Storage
%X <p>The main issues characterizing current video applications are their strong requirements for huge storage spaces andtheir need for timing synchronizationVideo data storageis a critical research topic due to the socalled IObottle neck problem which aects the quality of service of videoapplicationsThis paper introduces a two level video datarepresentation model in order to guide video data storage on a tertiary storage subsystemA simulation model hasbeen developed to evaluate dierent video placement strategies based on both Constructive and Iterative ImprovementapproachesExperimentation has been carried out for theproposed placement approaches as well as for a typical random placement policy which serves as a comparison refer enceIterative Improvement placement has been proven tooutperform the other considered video data placement approaches in both seek and service times.</p>
