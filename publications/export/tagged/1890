%X <p>Digital repositories are popular means for preserving,restoring, and indexing archaeological and cultural content.They provide the base for development of a fauna of relatedapplications including virtual tours and data management.

Withinthis context we propose and implement in practice a modelfor automated code generation building essentially a contentmanagement application by traversing a custom tree-based ERschema.</p>
