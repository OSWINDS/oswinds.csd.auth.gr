%K Model-Based Cluster Analysis
%X One of the main issues in Web usage mining is the discovery of patternsin the navigational behavior of Web users. Standard approaches, such as clusteringof usersâ€™sessions and discovering association rules or frequent navigational paths,do not generally allow to characterize or quantify the unobservable factors that leadto common navigational patterns. Therefore, it is necessary to develop techniquesthat can discover hidden and useful relationships among users as well as betweenusers and Web objects.Correspondence Analysis(CO-AN) is particularly useful inthis context, since it can uncover meaningful associations among users and pages.We present a model-based cluster analysis for Web users sessions including anovel visualization and interpretation approach which is based on CO-AN.
