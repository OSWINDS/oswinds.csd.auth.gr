%X <p>Multimedia data storage is a critical issue in relation to the overal l systems performanceand functionality This paper studies a multimediadocument application which eectively guides dataplacement towards improving the quality of presentation of multimedia data Several storage policiesare proposed towards better response and servicetimes Multimedia data dependencies access frequencies and timing constraints are used to guidethe storage policies under a certain representation model The proposed placement policies are basedon the simulated annealing algorithm and an extended improved version of the typical simulated annealing approach is presented Experimentation results are presented and their impact on the total systems performance is commented and evaluated.</p>
