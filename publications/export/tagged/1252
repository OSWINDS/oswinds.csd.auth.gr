%X <p>Web caching and content replication techniques emergedto solve performance problems related to the Web. We proposea generic non-parametric heuristic method that integratesboth techniques under a CDN. We provide experimentationshowing that our method outperforms the so farseparate implementations of Web caching and content replication.Moreover, we show that the performance improvementcompared with an existing algorithm is significant. Wetest all these techniques in a simulation environment undera flash crowd event and a workload of a typical lightweightedCDN operation.</p>
