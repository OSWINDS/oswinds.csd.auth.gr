	abstract = {<p>In recent years, offensive, abusive and hateful language, sexism, racism and other types of aggressive and cyberbullying behavior have been manifesting with increased frequency, and in many online social media platforms. In fact, past scientific work focused on studying these forms in popular media, such as Facebook and Twitter. Building on such work, we present an 8-month study of the various forms of abusive behavior on Twitter, in a holistic fashion. Departing from past work, we examine a wide variety of labeling schemes, which cover different forms of abusive behavior, at the same time. We propose an incremental and iterative methodology, that utilizes the power of crowdsourcing to annotate a large scale collection of tweets with a set of abuse-related labels. In fact, by applying our methodology including statistical analysis for label merging or elimination, we identify a reduced but robust set of labels. Finally, we offer a first overview and findings of our collected and annotated dataset of 100 thousand tweets, which we make publicly available for further scientific exploration.</p>

	abstract = {<p>Events constitute a significant means of multimedia content organizationand sharing. Despite the recent interest in detecting events and annotating mediacontent in an event-centric way, there is currently insufficient support for managingevents in large-scale content collections and limited understanding of the eventannotation process. To this end, this paper presents CrEve, a collaborative eventannotation framework which uses content found in social media sites with theprime objective to facilitate the annotation of large media corpora with eventinformation. The proposed annotation framework could significantly benefit socialmedia research due to the proliferation of event-related user-contributed content.We demonstrate that, compared to a standard {\^a}{\texteuro}{\'s}browse-and-annotate{\^a}{\texteuro}{\v t} interface,CrEve leads to a 19\% increase in the coverage of the generated ground truth in alarge-scale annotation experiment. Furthermore, the paper discusses the results of auser study that quantifies the performance of CrEve and the contribution of differentevent dimensions in the event annotation process. The study confirms the prevalenceof spatio-temporal queries as the prime option of discovering event-related contentin a large collection. In addition, textual queries and social cues (content contributor) were also found to be significant as event search dimensions. Finally, it demonstratesthe potential of employing automatic photo clustering methods with the goal offacilitating event annotation.</p>

	abstract = {<p>Artificial graphs are commonly used for theevaluation of community mining and clustering algorithms. Eachartificial graph is assigned a pre-specified clustering, which iscompared to clustering solutions obtained by the algorithmsunder evaluation. Hence, the pre-specified clustering shouldcomply with specifications that are assumed to delimit a goodclustering. However, existing construction processes for artificialgraphs do not set explicit specifications for the pre-specifiedclustering. We call these graphs, randomly clustered graphs.Here, we introduce a new class of benchmark graphs which areclustered according to explicit specifications. We call themoptimally clustered graphs. We present the basic properties ofoptimally clustered graphs and propose algorithms for theirconstruction. Experimentally, we compare two communitymining algorithms using both randomly and optimally clusteredgraphs. Results of this evaluation reveal interesting insights bothfor the algorithms and the artificial graphs.</p>

Inthe literature, a wide range of techniques has been developed,implemented and standardized for improving the performanceof CDNs. The ultimate goal of all the approachesis to improve the utility of CDN surrogate servers. In thispaper we define a metric which measures the utility of CDNsurrogate servers, called CDN utility. This metric capturesthe traffic activity in a CDN, expressing the usefulness ofsurrogate servers in terms of data circulation in the network.Through an extensive simulation testbed, we identifythe parameters that affect the CDN utility in such infrastructures.We evaluate the utility of surrogate servers undervarious parameters and provide insightful comments.</p>

Supporting videooperations (storing, searching by content, and streaming)and new query types (query by examples and multi-featuressimilarity search) requires major changes in many ofthe traditional system components.
