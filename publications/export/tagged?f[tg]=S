%X <p class="rtejustify">As smart cities infrastructures mature, data becomes a valuable asset which can radically improve city services and tools. Registration, acquisition and utilization of data, which will be transformed into smart services, are becoming more necessary than ever. Online social networks with their enormous momentum are one of the main sources of urban data offering heterogeneous real-time data at a minimal cost. However, various types of attacks often appear on them, which risk users' privacy and affect their online trust. The purpose of this article is to investigate how risks on online social networks affect smart cities and study the differences between privacy and security threats with regard to smart people and smart living dimensions.</p>

%X <p>Abstract Sentiment analysis and opinion mining are valuable for extraction of useful subjective information out of text documents. These tasks have become of great importance, especially for business and marketing professionals, since online posted products and services reviews impact markets and consumers shifts. This work is motivated by the fact that automating retrieval and detection of sentiments expressed for certain products and services embeds complex processes and pose research challenges, due to the textual phenomena and the language specific expression variations. This paper proposes a fast, flexible, generic methodology for sentiment detection out of textual snippets which express people’s opinions in different languages. The proposed methodology adopts a machine learning approach with which textual documents are represented by vectors and are used for training a polarity classification model. Several documents’ vector representation approaches have been studied, including lexicon-based, word embedding-based and hybrid vectorizations. The competence of these feature representations for the sentiment classification task is assessed through experiments on four datasets containing online user reviews in both Greek and English languages, in order to represent high and weak inflection language groups. The proposed methodology requires minimal computational resources, thus, it might have impact in real world scenarios where limited resources is the case.</p>

%X <p>We present an approach for detecting concepts in images bya graph-based semi-supervised learning scheme. The proposed approach builds a similarity graph between both the labeled and unlabeled images of the collection and uses the Laplacian Eigemaps of the graph as features for training concept detectors. Therefore, it offers multiple options for fusing different image features. In addition, we present an incremental learning scheme that, given a set of new unlabeled images, efficiently performs the computation of the Laplacian Eigenmaps. We evaluate the performance of our approach both on synthetic datasets and on MIR Flickr, comparing it with high-performance state-of-the-art learning schemes with competitive and in some cases superior results.</p>

%X <p>Smart city infrastructures provide unique opportunities for innovative applications developing and testing. Sensor city installations offer the ground for experimenting with user-oriented services, which at the same time can test and improve the infrastructure itself. The proposed work summarizes principles and methodology for and experiment, entitled SEN2SOC which will bridge sensor measurements and social networks interactions via natural language generation for supporting smart city services. SEN2SOC aims at exploiting the SmartSantander infrastructure in a sensor to social reciprocal fashion such that the sensor measurements will be and communicated to the public (citizens,authorities, etc), while social networks users activities in relevance to sensors social postings will be analyzed and summarized both to verify sensors reporting and to develop collective aware applications.</p>

%T Social Networking Trends and Dynamics Detection via a Cloud-based Framework Design
%X <p>Social networking media generate huge content streams, whichleverage, both academia and developers efforts in providingunbiased, powerful indications of users’ opinion and interests.Here, we present Cloud4Trends, a framework for collecting andanalyzing user generated content through microblogging andblogging applications, both separately and jointly, focused oncertain geographical areas, towards the identification of the mostsignificant topics using trend analysis techniques. The cloudcomputing paradigm appears to offer a significant benefit in orderto make such applications viable considering that the massive datasizes produced daily impose the need of a scalable and powerfulinfrastructure. Cloud4Trends constitutes an efficient Cloud-basedapproach in order to solve the online trend tracking problem basedon Web 2.0 sources. A detailed system architecture model is alsoproposed, which is largely based on a set of service modulesdeveloped within the VENUS-C research project to facilitate thedeployment of research applications on Cloud infrastructures.</p>

%T Social Web Mashups Full Completion via Frequent Sequence Mining
%X <p>In this paper we address the problem of WebMashups full completion which consists of predicting themost suitable set of (combined) services that successfully meetthe goals of an end-user Mashup, given the current service(or composition of services) initially supplied. We model fullcompletion as a frequent sequence mining problem and weshow how existing algorithms can be applied in this context.To overcome some limitations of the frequent sequence miningalgorithms, e.g., efficiency and recommendation granularity,we propose FESMA, a new and efficient algorithm for computingfrequent sequences of services and recommending completions.FESMA also integrates a social dimension, extractedfrom the transformation of user → service interactions intouser → user interactions, building an implicit graph thathelps to better predict completions of services in a fashiontailored to individual users. Evaluations show that FESMAis more efficient outperforming the existing algorithms evenwith the consideration of the social dimension. Our proposalhas been implemented in a prototype, SoCo, developed at BellLabs.</p>

%T SEMSOC: Semantics Mining on Multimedia Social Data Sources
%X <p>A huge amount of data and metadata emerges fromWeb 2.0 applications which have transformed the Webto a mass social interaction and collabo-ration medium.Collaborative Tagging Systems is a typical,popular and promising Web 2.0 application and despiteits adoption it faces some serious limitations thatrestrict their usability. These limitations (no structureon tags, tags validation, spamming and redundancy)are more evident in the case of multi-media contentdue to its challenging automatic annotation and retrievalrequirements. In this paper, we present an approachfor social data clustering which combinesjointly semantic, social and content-based information.We propose an unsupervised model for efficient andscalable mining on multimedia social-related data,which leads to the extraction of rich and trustworthysemantics and the improvement of retrieval in a socialtagging system. Experimental results demonstrate theefficiency of the proposed approach.</p>

Increasing amounts of informationare being stored in LDAP directories imposing the need for efficientdata organization and retrieval. In this paper, we propose the LPAIR&amp; LMERGE (LP-LM) hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithmfor improving LDAP data organization.

The proposed approach takes into account and exploits the specific characteristics of XML data and incorporates the flexibility of Role based Access Control policies.

%T A Simulation Study of Shadowed Disks
%X <p>Multiple disks have been introduced for use in I/O subsystems to increase data availability and fault tolerance. Identical disks (comprising the shadowed disks) sets have been adopted as an effective secondary storage replication scheme. In the present paper, we introduce a shadowed disk model and mathematically analyze its theoritical expected performance measures by applying the nearer-server rule to satisfy the requests. In addition, we introduce the corresponding simulation model, where each disk is modeled by means of a protoype disk configuration and specific commercial disks metrics. Furthermore, the mirrored disks model is studied extensively as a boundary disk topology of the shadowed disks set. The developed simulation model is experimented and tested under various workloads produced by real I/O traces. The performance of the simulation model is compared to the analytical results and, thus, it is validated since analysis and simulation give close results.</p>
