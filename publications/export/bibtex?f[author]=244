	abstract = {<p>Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) provide an efficient support for serving {\^a}{\texteuro}{\'s}resourcehungry{\^a}{\texteuro}{\v t}applications while minimizing the network impact of content delivery as well asshifting the traffic away from overloaded origin servers. However, their performance gain islimited since the storage space in CDN{\^a}{\texteuro}{\texttrademark}s servers is not used optimally. In order to managetheir storage capacity in an efficient way, we integrate caching techniques in CDNs. Thechallenge is to decide which objects would be devoted to caching so as the CDN{\^a}{\texteuro}{\texttrademark}s server maybe used both as a replicator and as a proxy server. In this paper we propose a nonlinear nonparametricmodel which classifies the CDN{\^a}{\texteuro}{\texttrademark}s server cache into two parts. Through a detailedsimulation environment, we show that the proposed technique can yield significant reductionin user-perceived latency as compared with other heuristic schemes.</p>

	abstract = {<p>Web caching and content replication techniques emergedto solve performance problems related to the Web. We proposea generic non-parametric heuristic method that integratesboth techniques under a CDN. We provide experimentationshowing that our method outperforms the so farseparate implementations of Web caching and content replication.Moreover, we show that the performance improvementcompared with an existing algorithm is significant. Wetest all these techniques in a simulation environment undera flash crowd event and a workload of a typical lightweightedCDN operation.</p>
