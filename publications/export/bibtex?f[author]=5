	abstract = {<p>In recent years, offensive, abusive and hateful language, sexism, racism and other types of aggressive and cyberbullying behavior have been manifesting with increased frequency, and in many online social media platforms. In fact, past scientific work focused on studying these forms in popular media, such as Facebook and Twitter. Building on such work, we present an 8-month study of the various forms of abusive behavior on Twitter, in a holistic fashion. Departing from past work, we examine a wide variety of labeling schemes, which cover different forms of abusive behavior, at the same time. We propose an incremental and iterative methodology, that utilizes the power of crowdsourcing to annotate a large scale collection of tweets with a set of abuse-related labels. In fact, by applying our methodology including statistical analysis for label merging or elimination, we identify a reduced but robust set of labels. Finally, we offer a first overview and findings of our collected and annotated dataset of 100 thousand tweets, which we make publicly available for further scientific exploration.</p>

	address = {Vancouver, Canada},
	abstract = {<p>Common approaches to text categorization essentially rely either on n-gram counts or on word embeddings. This presents important difficulties in highly dynamic or quickly-interacting environments, where the appearance of new words and/or varied misspellings is the norm. A paradigmatic example of this situation is abusive online behavior, with social networks and media platforms struggling to effectively combat uncommon or non-blacklisted hate words. To better deal with these issues in those fast-paced environments, we propose using the error signal of class-based language models as input to text classification algorithms. In particular, we train a next-character prediction model for any given class, and then exploit the error of such class-based models to inform a neural network classifier. This way, we shift from the ability to describe seen documents to the ability to predict unseen content. Preliminary studies using out-of-vocabulary splits from abusive tweet data show promising results, outperforming competitive text categorization strategies by 4{\textendash}11\%.</p>

The proposed approaches are tested on three datasets collected from different sources, i.e., news agencies, Twitter, and Facebook, and on different languages, i.e., English and Greek.

Results from factor analyses discerned a three factor emotion structure (positive, negative, and anxious emotions) that was largely shared between CMC and FtF social interactions. Multilevel analyses of emotion across modes of interaction found that in FtF social encounters participants experienced more positive and less negative emotion and higher satisfaction than in CMC; there was no difference in anxious emotion. Positive, but not negative emotions or anxiety partially mediated levels of satisfaction differences between interactions in CMC and those taking place FtF.

	abstract = {<p>Over the past few years, online bullying and aggression have become increasingly prominent, and manifested in many different forms on social media. However, there is little work analyzing the characteristics of abusive users and what distinguishes them from typical social media users. In this paper, we start addressing this gap by analyzing tweets containing a great amount of abusiveness. We focus on a Twitter dataset revolving around the Gamergate controversy, which led to many incidents of cyberbullying and cyberaggression on various gaming and social media platforms. We study the properties of the users tweeting about Gamergate, the content they post, and the differences in their behavior compared to typical Twitter users.</p>

<p>We find that while their tweets are often seemingly about aggressive and hateful subjects, {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}Gamergaters{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright} do not exhibit common expressions of online anger, and in fact primarily differ from typical users in that their tweets are less joyful. They are also more engaged than typical Twitter users, which is an indication as to how and why this controversy is still ongoing. Surprisingly, we find that Gamergaters are less likely to be suspended by Twitter, thus we analyze their properties to identify differences from typical users and what may have led to their suspension. We perform an unsupervised machine learning analysis to detect clusters of users who, though currently active, could be considered for suspension since they exhibit similar behaviors with suspended users. Finally, we confirm the usefulness of our analyzed features by emulating the Twitter suspension mechanism with a supervised learning method, achieving very good precision and recall.</p>

	abstract = {<p>In recent years, bullying and aggression against users on social media have grown significantly, causing serious consequences to victims of all demographics. In particular, cyberbullying affects more than half of young social media users worldwide, and has also led to teenage suicides, prompted by prolonged and/or coordinated digital harassment. Nonetheless, tools and technologies for understanding and mitigating it are scarce and mostly ineffective. In this paper, we present a principled and scalable approach to detect bullying and aggressive behavior on Twitter. We propose a robust methodology for extracting text, user, and network-based attributes, studying the properties of cyberbullies and aggressors, and what features distinguish them from regular users. We find that bully users post less, participate in fewer online communities, and are less popular than normal users, while aggressors are quite popular and tend to include more negativity in their posts. We evaluate our methodology using a corpus of 1.6M tweets posted over 3 months, and show that machine learning classification algorithms can accurately detect users exhibiting bullying and aggressive behavior, achieving over 90\% AUC.</p>

Started in August 2014 in the online gaming world, it quickly spread across various social networking platforms, ultimately leading to many incidents of cyberbullying and cyberaggression. We focus on Twitter, presenting a measurement study of a dataset of 340k unique users and 1.6M tweets to study the properties of these users, the content they post, and how they differ from random Twitter users. We find that users involved in this "Twitter war" tend to have more friends and followers, are generally more engaged and post tweets with negative sentiment, less joy, and more hate than random users. We also perform preliminary measurements on how the Twitter suspension mechanism deals with such abusive behaviors. While we focus on Gamergate, our methodology to collect and analyze tweets related to aggressive and bullying activities is of independent interest.</p>

This paper proposes a fast, flexible, generic methodology for sentiment detection out of textual snippets which express people{\textquoteright}s opinions in different languages. The proposed methodology adopts a machine learning approach with which textual documents are represented by vectors and are used for training a polarity classification model. Several documents{\textquoteright} vector representation approaches have been studied, including lexicon-based, word embedding-based and hybrid vectorizations. The competence of these feature representations for the sentiment classification task is assessed through experiments on four datasets containing online user reviews in both Greek and English languages, in order to represent high and weak inflection language groups. The proposed methodology requires minimal computational resources, thus, it might have impact in real world scenarios where limited resources is the case.</p>

The proposed approach relies on matrix factorization to compute the PerSaDoR of documents that match a query, at query time. The complexity analysis shows that our approach scales linearly with the number of documents that match the query, and thus, it can scale to very large datasets. PerSaDoR has been also intensively evaluated by an offline study and by a user survey operated on a large public dataset from delicious showing significant benefits for personalized search compared to state of the art methods.</p>

	abstract = {<p>In social media, users{\textquoteright} interactions are affected by real-world events which influence emergence and shifts of opinions and topics. Interactions around an event-related topic can be captured in a weighted network, while identification of connectivity and intensity patterns can improve understanding of users{\textquoteright} interest on the topic. Community detection is studied here as a means to reveal groups of social media users with common interaction patterns in such networks. The proposed community detection approach identifies communities exploiting both structural properties and intensity patterns, while dynamics of communities{\textquoteright} evolution around an event are revealed based on an iterative community detection and mapping scheme. We investigate the importance of considering interactions{\textquoteright} intensity for community detection via a benchmarking process on synthetic graphs and propose a generic framework for: i) modeling user interactions, ii) identifying static and evolving communities around events, iii) extracting quantitative and qualitative measurements from the communities{\textquoteright} timeline, iv) leveraging measurements to understand the events{\textquoteright} impact. Two real-world case studies based on Twitter interactions demonstrate the framework{\textquoteright}s potential for capturing and interpreting associations among communities and events.</p>

	abstract = {<p>Events constitute a significant means of multimedia content organizationand sharing. Despite the recent interest in detecting events and annotating mediacontent in an event-centric way, there is currently insufficient support for managingevents in large-scale content collections and limited understanding of the eventannotation process. To this end, this paper presents CrEve, a collaborative eventannotation framework which uses content found in social media sites with theprime objective to facilitate the annotation of large media corpora with eventinformation. The proposed annotation framework could significantly benefit socialmedia research due to the proliferation of event-related user-contributed content.We demonstrate that, compared to a standard {\^a}{\texteuro}{\'s}browse-and-annotate{\^a}{\texteuro}{\v t} interface,CrEve leads to a 19\% increase in the coverage of the generated ground truth in alarge-scale annotation experiment. Furthermore, the paper discusses the results of auser study that quantifies the performance of CrEve and the contribution of differentevent dimensions in the event annotation process. The study confirms the prevalenceof spatio-temporal queries as the prime option of discovering event-related contentin a large collection. In addition, textual queries and social cues (content contributor) were also found to be significant as event search dimensions. Finally, it demonstratesthe potential of employing automatic photo clustering methods with the goal offacilitating event annotation.</p>

	abstract = {<p>Multimedia data indexing for content-based retrieval has attractedsignificant attention in recent years due to the commoditizationof multimedia capturing equipment and the widespread adoption of social networking platforms as means for sharing media content online. Due to the very large amounts of multimedia content, notably images, produced and shared online by people, a very important requirement for multimedia indexing approaches pertains to their efficiency both in terms of computation and memory usage. A common approach to support query-by-example image search is based on the extraction of visual words from images and their indexing by means of inverted indices, a method proposed and popularized in the field of text retrieval.The main challenge that visual word indexing systems currently facearises from the fact that it is necessary to build very large visual vocabularies (hundreds of thousands or even millions of words) to support sufficiently precise search. However, when the visual vocabulary is large,the image indexing process becomes computationally expensive due to the fact that the local image descriptors (e.g. SIFT) need to be quantized to the nearest visual words.To this end, this paper proposes a novel method that significantly decreases the time required for the above quantization process. Instead of using hundreds of thousands of visual words for quantization, the proposed method manages to preserve retrieval quality by using a much smaller number of words for indexing. This is achieved by the concept of composite words, i.e. assigning multiple words to a local descriptor in ascending order of distance. We evaluate the proposed method in the Oxford and Paris buildings datasets to demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach.</p>

Totake advantage of this neglected information, we introduce a novel dissimilarity-based recommenderthat bases its estimations on degrees of dissimilarities among items{\^a}{\texteuro}{\texttrademark} attributes. However, instead of usingthe proposed recommender as a stand-alone method, we combine it with similarity-based ones to maintainthe selective nature of the latter while detecting, through our recommender, information that mayhave been overlooked. Such combinations are established by IANOS, a proposed framework throughwhich we increase the accuracy of two popular similarity-based recommenders (Naive Bayes andSlope-One) after their combination with our algorithm. Improved accuracy results in experimentationon two datasets (Yahoo! Movies and Movielens) enhance our reasoning. However, the proposed recommendercomes with an additional computational complexity when combined with other techniques. Byusing Hadoop technology, we developed a distributed version of IANOS through which execution timewas reduced. Evaluation on IANOS procedures in terms of time performance endorses the use of distributedimplementations.</p>

However, tags suffer from severallimitations{\^a}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblright}such as polysemy, lack of uniformity,and spam{\^a}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblright}thus not presenting an adequatesolution to the problem of contentorganization. Therefore, automated contentorganizationmethods are of particular importanceto improve the content-consumptionexperience.

It{\^a}{\texteuro}{\texttrademark}s for this reasonthat automating the process of detecting suchconcepts in large image sets can enhance theexperience of accessing massive amounts ofpictorial content.In this article, we present a novel scheme forautomatically detecting landmarks and eventsin tagged image collections. Our proposal isbased on the simple yet elegant concept ofimage similarity graphs as a means of combiningmultiple notions of similarity betweenimages in a photo collection; in our case, weuse visual and tag similarity. We perform clusteringon such image similarity graphs bymeans of community detection,1 a processthat identifies on the graph groups of nodesthat are more densely connected to eachother than to the rest of the network. In contrastto conventional clustering schemes suchas k-means or hierarchical agglomerative clustering,community detection is computationallymore efficient and doesn{\^a}{\texteuro}{\texttrademark}t require thenumber of clusters to be provided as input. Subsequently,we classify the resulting image clustersas landmarks or events by use of featuresrelated to the temporal, social, and tag characteristicsof image clusters. In the case of landmarks,we also conduct a cluster-merging stepon the basis of spatial proximity to enrich ourlandmark model.</p>

Content Distribution Networks (CDNs) are one of these popular systems which try to make the contents closer to the widely dispersed Internet users. A Content Distribution Network provides its services by using a number of surrogate servers geographicallydistributed in the web. Surrogate servers have the copies of the original contents belonging to the origin server, depending on their storage capacity.When a client requests for some particular contents from a surrogateserver, either this request can be fulfilled directly by it or in case of absence of the requested contents, surrogate servers cooperate with eachother or with the origin server. In this paper, our focus is on the surrogate servers utilization and using it as a parameter to conserve energy in CDNs while trying to maintain an acceptable Quality of Experience (QoE).</p>

This article attempts to provideinsights into the dynamics emerging from the process of content rating by the user community.To this end, the article proposes a framework for the study of the statistical properties of an SBS,the evolution of bookmarked content popularity and user activity in time, as well as the impact ofonline social networks on the content consumption behavior of individuals.

An established technique to overcome such an overload is to cluster images into groups based on their similarity and then use the derived clusters to assistnavigation and browsing of the collection. In this paper, we presenta community detection (i.e. graph-based clustering) approach thatmakes use of both visual and tagging features of images in orderto efficiently extract groups of related images within large imagecollections. Based on experiments we conducted on a dataset comprising publicly available images from Flickr{\^A}{\textdegree}c, we demonstrate the efficiency of our method, the added value of combining visual andtag features and the utility of the derived clusters for exploring animage collection.</p>

Devising an efficientcontent outsourcing policy is crucial since, based on such policies, CDN providers can provide client-tailored content, improveperformance, and result in significant economical gains. Earlier content outsourcing approaches may often prove ineffective since theydrive prefetching decisions by assuming knowledge of content popularity statistics, which are not always available and are extremelyvolatile. This work addresses this issue, by proposing a novel self-adaptive technique under a CDN framework on which outsourcedcontent is identified with no a priori knowledge of (earlier) request statistics.

This fact poses newchallenges for the mobile industry, which needs to develop and adapt useful and appealing services for theusers in order to enhance the role of the mobile phone as a mainstream device. Adopting and using mobilesocial networks sites and other Web 2.0 services is expected to be inline with such a mobile technologytrend. Current mobile web technologies offer a computer-like user-experience since a user can easilygenerate and share digital content from his/her mobile. However, current services and applications do notinclude techniques for analyzing this mass user-generated input (e.g. content, annotations), user interactions(e.g. ranking) and social interactions (e.g. relationships). Knowledge extracted from this massive usercontribution and interaction can offer personalized added-value services enabling more efficient mobileusage.

	abstract = {<p>This paper describes an approach for semantic description and retrieval of multimedia data described by means ofMPEG-7. This standard uses XML schema to define the descriptions. Therefore, it lacks ability to represent the data semanticsin a formal and concise way and it does not allow integration and use of domain specific knowledge. Moreover,inference mechanisms are not provided and hence the extraction of implicit information is not (always) possible. To addressthese issues, we propose to add a conceptual layer on top of MPEG-7 metadata layer, where the domain knowledgeis represented using a formal language. A set of mapping rules is proposed. They serve as a bridge between the twolayers.Querying MPEG-7 descriptions using XML query languages such as XPath or XQuery requires to know MPEG-7syntax and documents structure. To provide a flexible query formulation, we exploit the conceptual layer vocabularyto express user queries. A user query, making reference to terms specified at the conceptual level, is rewritten into anXQuery expression over MPEG-7 descriptions.</p>

Therefore, accessto XML data sources has become a crucial issue. In this paper we introduce acredential-based access control framework for protecting XML resources. Underthis framework, we propose the use of access policy files containing policiesconcerning a specific credentials type. Moreover, we propose the reorganizationof the policies in these files based on their frequency of use (the morefrequently it is used the higher in the file it is placed). Our main goal is to improverequest servicing times. Several experiments have been conducted whichare carried out either on single request or on multiple requests base. The proposedframework is proven quite beneficial for protecting XML-based frameworkssuch as digital libraries or any other data resources whose format is expressedin XML.</p>

Animportant component of any strong security solution is representedby intrusion detection (ID) systems, able to detectanomalous behavior by applications and users. To date,however, there have been very few ID mechanisms specificallytailored to database systems. In this paper, we proposesuch a mechanism. The approach we propose to IDis based on mining database traces stored in log files. Theresult of the mining process is used to form user profilesthat can model normal behavior and identify intruders. Anadditional feature of our approach is that we couple ourmechanism with Role Based Access Control (RBAC). Undera RBAC system permissions are associated with roles, usuallygrouping several users, rather than with single users.Our ID system is able to determine role intruders, that is,individuals that while holding a specific role, have a behaviordifferent from the normal behavior of the role. Animportant advantage of providing an ID mechanism specifi-cally tailored to databases is that it can also be used to protectagainst insider threats. Furthermore, the use of rolesmakes our approach usable even for databases with largeuser population. Our preliminary experimental evaluationon both real and synthetic database traces show that ourmethods work well in practical situations.</p>

This paper proposesa framework for the description and retrieval of multimediadata. The data are represented at both the syntactic(structure, metadata and low level features) and semantic(the meaning of the data) levels. We use the MPEG-7 standard,which provides a set of tools to describe multimediacontent from different viewpoints, to represent the syntacticlevel. However, due to its XML Schema based representation,MPEG-7 is not suitable to represent the semanticaspect of the data in a formal and concise way. Moreover,inferential mechanisms are not provided. To alleviate theselimitations, we propose to extend MPEG-7 with a domainontology, formalized using a logical formalism. Then, thesemantic aspect of the data is described using the ontology{\^a}{\texteuro}{\texttrademark}svocabulary, as a set of logical expressions. We enhancethe ontology by a rules layer, to describe more complexconstraints between domain concepts and relations.User{\^a}{\texteuro}{\texttrademark}s queries may concern the syntactic and/or semanticfeatures. The syntactic constraints are expressed usingXQuery language and evaluated using an XML query engine;whereas the semantic query constraints are expressedusing a rules language and evaluated using a specific resolutionmechanism.},

Thus, access controlmechanisms should also be distributed in order to protect them effectively. A recentidea in the access control theory is the delegation and revocation of rights,i.e. the passing over of one clients rights to the other and vice versa. Here, wepropose an XML-based distributed delegation module which can be integratedinto a distributed role-based access control mechanism protecting networks. Theidea of X.509v3 certificates is used for the transfer of authorization informationreferring to a client. The modules are XML-based and all of the associated datastructures are expressed through Document Type Definitions (DTDs).</p>

It is on the way to become the new standard for data exchange, publishing, and developing intelligent Web agents. XML is based on the concept of documents composed of a series of entities (i.e., objects). Each entity can contain one or more logical elements. Each of these elements can have certain attributes (properties) that describe the way in which it is to be processed. XML provides a formal syntax for describing the relationships between the entities, elements and attributes that make up an XML document.
