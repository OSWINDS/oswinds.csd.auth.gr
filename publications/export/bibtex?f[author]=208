	abstract = {<p>In this paper we present a web mining tool which automaticallyextracts the structure, content and usage data statistics of websites. This work inspired by the fact that web mining consists ofthree axes: web structure mining, web content mining and webusage mining. Each one of those axes is using the structure,content and usage data respectively. The scope is to use thedeveloped multi-thread web crawler as a tool to automaticallyextract from web pages data that are associated with each one ofthose three axes in order afterwards to compute several usefuldescriptive statistics and apply advanced mathematical andstatistical methods. A description of our system is provided aswell as some experimentation results.</p>
