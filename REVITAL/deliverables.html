					<a href="https://oswinds.csd.auth.gr/REVITAL/deliverables/EINS_deliverable_D2_1.pdf" target="_blank">Social network analysis report</a></br>
					<hr>
					<p align="justify">The explosion of using all 
						forms of social networks, such as Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, leads to an unprecedented 
						content production from which valuable information can be extracted. Specifically, 
						the analysis of users’ emotions as these are imprinted in such social networks 
						can provide information for various parties, such as stakeholders, companies, 
						sociologists or even for the users themselves. The recognition and analysis of 
						such emotional information is known as sentiment/affective analysis, which is 
						the process of detecting sentiments from texts. In other words, it determines 
						the emotions being expressed in a piece of text. In the following sections 
						we describe two sentiment analysis approaches that have been implemented and 
						applied in content which has been extracted from users’ activity in Facebook, 
						the very popular and widely used social network. Within the REVITAL project was 
						conducted a 15-days experiment where the Facebook accounts of 38 users were 
						monitored for retrieving the messages/posts that they have exchanged with their 
						online social connections. With an initial data analysis of such data we can 
						conclude that the most dominant emotions tend to be the emotions of surprise and joy. 
						In this deliverable we provide a comprehensive description of the developed approaches
						 and some initial results that are related to the introduction of such methodologies
						  in content produced by users’ activity in social network. </p></br>
					
					<a href="https://oswinds.csd.auth.gr/REVITAL/deliverables/EINS_deliverable_D3_1.pdf" target="_blank">Real life affective experience report</a></br>
					<hr>
					<p align="justify">People utilize their social networks constantly on a daily basis in real, face to face, 
						or in virtual social interactions, over the Internet. In such real and virtual social 
						interactions emotions have an important role. People are driven by their emotions when 
						they express opinions, interact and communicate for multiple everyday life tasks. 
						However, the study of naturally occurring emotions in virtual interactions is limited.					
						The REVITAL study adopted a combined methodology to study emotion experience in real and 
						virtual social interactions using: (a) an experience sampling methodology (ESM) of emotion 
						states in real and virtual social interactions, and (b), a lexicon-based approach to identify 
						the emotions expressed in naturally occurring computer-mediated communications and to verify 
						the results extracted from the previously conducted analysis (i.e., offline social activities’ analysis).
						The focus of this deliverable is the application of the ESM methodology in the RETUNE's data and its respective results.</p></br>

					<hr>
					<p align="justify">
						The REVITAL project aims at contributing in understanding how people’s emotions are 
						formulated in their online and offline social activities. The analysis of people’s emotions 
						in their online social activity can be conducted by analyzing the content provided by them 
						in their social networks. But for the offline social activity the people themselves have to 
						explicitly provide information about how they feel throughout their everyday interactions with 
						their surrounding environment (e.g. family, friends, and co-workers). So, in order to provide users 
						with an easy to use way to manually declare such emotions, we developed a mobile and web application. 
						In this deliverable we describe these applications in relation to their technical and functional characteristics.
